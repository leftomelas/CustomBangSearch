mojeek.com | ✅ |
searx.tiekoetter.com | ✅ |
startpage.com | ✅ |
ecosia.org | ✅ |
searx.be | ✅ |
qwant.com | ❌ | Does not work because it GETs https://api.qwant.com/v3/search/web?q= in the background, not in `main_frame`. Even if we did catch it, redirecting that doesn't redirect the actual page the user is loading. Support could be added if there's interest.
